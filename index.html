        <h4 class="paddingOnMobile centered sub subHeadline">Introduction</h4>
        <p class="justified">Hello! My full name is Vikintas Raudavicius, I’m 26 years old and I’m from Lithuania. Recently, I have discovered a passion and goal to become a full-time Web Developer and being a visual person, I was geared towards Front-End specifically. Since then a lot of my time was invested into learning the ropes of the craft and I am absolutely loving it! As a person, people find me as a proactive, ambitious and fun guy to be around and I am not going to argue with that. When it comes to hobbies, I love writing, you will often find me writing random songs, lines, stories – it is essentially my way of doodling.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 col-md-pull-4">
        <h4 class="centered subHeadline">Why me?</h4>
        <p class="justified">While I am not an expert in the industry, nor I know all there is, but I think no one does. And that is what makes it so appealing – the infinite learning process. I believe that one of the things that make me stand out is that, being naturally curious, I very much enjoy the constant learning process, which makes me a very fast and dedicated learner. Although, I already having a working knowledge of the craft, I am fully confident that any forward-thinking company looking for someone to grow and improve within the team, just found the right person. </p>

This knowledge translates very well into Front-End Web Development, as I developed a strong ability to effectively communicate with customers, that I can use in practice. Throughout the studies, I acted as a leader of group for majority of the assignments, thus I managed to acquire great communication and leadership skills, while also learning to work within groups of different people. I would say that Digital Marketing was my favourite topic, as it combines traditional marketing strategies with constantly evolving technologies, which open up great new opportunities.</p>
